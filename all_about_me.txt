Hobbies & Interests:
I’m from Pakistan and a huge fan of Python and Generative AI, especially Multimodal LLMs. I love building software around foundation models—and sometimes even getting behind the models themselves (because curiosity is a tough habit to break 😆). When I’m not fixing bugs or building ideas, you’ll find me playing cricket 🏏, hunting 🎯, target shooting 🔫, lifting weights 🏋️, or spending time with friends and family.
